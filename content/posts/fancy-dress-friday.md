Sorted out fancy dress box.

Joined in with Fancy Dress Friday on today’s PE with Joe. The children spent the entire day prior in fancy dress, too. They were so animated by the thought of others doing the same thing on the same day! I was nominated to be a teddy for the occasion, with Pudsey Bear ears, coordinating yellow top, brown leggings, and bunches tied up with brown scrunchies. I was also given a “baby bear” mascot to carry around in my hoodie pocket.

Lazily drove to the local pharmacy to pick up my prescription, to discover they’re open only two hours a day for now, so I was six hours late! Will try again in the morning.

Andi built a den for the girls while I got them ready for bed. They absolutely loved it - it was a proper blanket fort. However when bedtime arrived they decided they weren’t ready to sleep in it, so looks like dens are for daytime until they’re a little older.

Turkey Dinosaurs, tinned potatoes, peas and gravy for a very grown up meal indeed! With a film; The Post. Really enjoyed the film, even if It required us to brush up on the modern history behind it beforehand. Well worth the watch.
