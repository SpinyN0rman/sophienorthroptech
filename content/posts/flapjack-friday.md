It took two children to help me make flapjack, and to lick the pan spin and span of golden syrupy goodness.

It took two neighbours to hold a brief conversation from a fair distance apart, which cheered me (one of them) up.

It took two “thank you Mummy”s to melt my heart after dinners had been eaten.

It took way more than two days after dismantling the kitchen to get round to putting it back together again with some sort of coherence.. so glad it’s finally done!

It Takes Two. The three females in the household watched the film starring the Olsen twins this afternoon - I’m not sure the one male would have tolerated it! I enjoy the odd cute romcom like this, and was more than happy to switch off to it. Attempted a nap but didn’t happen this time.
