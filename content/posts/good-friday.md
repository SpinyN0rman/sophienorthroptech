Garden, so warm.

tidying up last years sweet pea stalks, lunch out there.

clipped and cut Andi’s hair with a bit of assistance.

chatted to neighbour and appreciated some of her music. Tove lo!

lumidee? Gosh haven’t heard that one in a while! So dissonant but great beat and movement of track, never been sure if I love it or hate it.

Tidying up indoors. Feels like I’m Following the girls around. Since having children of my own I understand some of the things my parents used to say to me which seemed so unreasonable at the time! Getting all the craft up off the lounge floor and Hoovering 3 rooms and the landing satisfying. The amount of sh%@ and cat hair that collects on the carpet makes me look forward to hard floors in the jungle bungalow with disproportionate excitement! Andi angelically put away two mountains of clean laundry.
