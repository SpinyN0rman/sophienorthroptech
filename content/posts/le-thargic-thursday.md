This lovely sloth was given to Amber by one of her uncles for a Christmas gift. She was playing with it today, and I thought “yes, I feel like one of those!”

  
Made vegan cupcakes with children. All the different spellings of “cake” were amazing!! My favourite though is “cacks”

Did some Times Tables Rockstars

Played Exploding Kittens with friends
