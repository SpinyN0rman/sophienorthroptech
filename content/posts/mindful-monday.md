Clara told me something was going to be “Fableous” today. I love it when she says that word! Our eldest also slipped rather sweetly on a longer word today, but already I’ve forgotten what it was...

Kids are planning a shop - wanted to call it a charity shop but couldn’t comprehend that the money they made would be going to a chosen charity..

“So you mean a second hand shop?”

Felt dizzy so spent the latter part of the morning curled up under a blanket on the sofa, with Countdown on in the background until I perked up. Does that count as homeschooling? Amber attempted the words round and got the word “word” which is a decent match for anything I usually come up with! I prefer the numbers round but the one I caught today before drifting off flummoxed all of us except for Rachel.

Wove Grandma a rainbow using a stick found previously in the woods for the curve guide. I warned Amber I’d not woven since school, but after a very slow start (the fabric just didn’t seem to stay where we put it) it eventually took shape and we are thrilled with the finished piece. Probably took the best part of two hours or so. Now just to wrap it and post it for part of Grandma’s belated birthday gift.

Clearing the top drawer of the freezer this evening to make room for a few more bits from tomorrow’s fortnightly food shop. I’m both looking forward to a change of scenery and some replenished cupboards, and dreading being out amongst other shoppers at the same time. Which is insane; I enjoy browsing the isles while inventing meals, and chatting to people usually. I think my asthma being less controlled is a worry.

The Queen. I’ve been thinking since lockdown began that one thing I expect and want to do more of during this time is pray. And I was reminded of this again by none other than Queen Elizabeth II as she gave her address today. It comes as a surprise to me that when I think about it I am actually praying less than before this lockdown started. But it ought not to come as a surprise - put two and two together Soph... both children are at home, all the time!! I tend not to put myself down for not “performing well” like this any more, since I adopted over the last few years an opinion which echoes C S Lewis‘: God (who is Love) doesn’t want something from us. He (or She I hear you say) just wants us. As we are. Our attention, our ear, our emotion, our daily tasks, our personality, our pondering, our TV viewing, internet scrolling, our dancing around the kitchen, our mealtime musing, our fears, our interests and interconnectedness, and whatever else makes us us?!

Nonetheless I can continue to be thankful every day for life and all that I have. And perhaps I will be able to find time to light a candle in the evening or even with the kids to pray for those who are currently suffering the most - this isn’t limited to a pandemic, but sure is being magnified because of it. God bless this world and help us to care for it..
