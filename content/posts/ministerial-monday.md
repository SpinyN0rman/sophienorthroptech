Another beautifully sunny day, we occupied the patio for a solid three hours, until the last of the warmth giving light disappeared into a sorry corner. I savoured putting the laundry out, and watching the children play (sometimes well, even beautifully, peppered with the usual spats). They rode their various wheels, see sawed, made a den out of one of their old baby blankets, _March Sunbathed_, and shivered slightly while eating lunch al fresco. I swept up some leaves and rubbish, most of which had blown into our plot via a fairly typical whirlwind created on the other side of the fence, where a business’ parking spaces sit in a sort of miniature courtyard with access from the road. It was a small job, but always satisfying.

After fresh air above and beyond our quota we moved back upstairs for a film, _You Can Tutu_, available currently on Netflix. The girls have watched this intently about three times to date, sinking into the world of amateur ballet competitions, friendship and family dynamics. The low budget characteristics of the picture flies completely over their heads every time, while I dip in an out, mostly cringing but sometimes enjoying! I noticed with delight the name of an old secondary school classmate in the titles. Sophie Munro Pruett
