Another beautifully sunny day, we occupied the patio for a solid three hours, until the last of the warmth giving light disappeared into a sorry corner. I savoured putting the laundry out, and watching the children play (sometimes well, even beautifully, peppered with the usual spats). They rode their various wheels, see sawed, made a den out of one of their old baby blankets, _March Sunbathed_, and shivered slightly while eating lunch al fresco. I swept up some leaves and rubbish, most of which had blown into our plot via a fairly typical whirlwind created on the other side of the fence, where the local garage customers sometimes park their vehicles. It was a small job, but always satisfying.
