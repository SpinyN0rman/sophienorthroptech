Another beautifully sunny day, we occupied the patio for a solid three hours, until the last of the warmth giving light disappeared into a sorry corner. I savoured putting the laundry out, and watching the children play (sometimes well, even beautifully, peppered with the usual spats). They rode their various wheels, see sawed, made a den out of one of their old baby blankets, _March Sunbathed_, and shivered slightly while eating lunch al fresco. I swept up some leaves and rubbish, most of which had blown into our plot via a fairly typical whirlwind created on the other side of the fence, where a business’ parking spaces sit in a sort of miniature courtyard with access from the road. It was a small job, but always satisfying.

After fresh air above and beyond our quota we moved back upstairs for a film, _You Can Tutu_, available currently on Netflix. The girls have watched this intently about three times to date, sinking into the world of amateur ballet competitions, friendship and family dynamics. The low budget characteristics of the picture flies completely over their heads every time, while I dip in and out, mostly cringing but sometimes enjoying! I noticed with delight the name of an old secondary school classmate in the titles: Sophie Monro-Pruett’s costumes were a highlight; she’s a real talent.

Folk around the country have started putting up pictures of rainbows in their windows so that passers by can have a bit of fun spotting them and share in solidarity. These last few days have felt as unreal as the computer generated image above, which my daughter made a while back.

Dinner was salmon from the freezer, with a small amount of brown rice, and some leftover couscous. I baked the salmon with broccoli, and used up some shop-bought breadcrumbs and half a packet of parsley sauce. Not sure if I’m selling it or not, but it was delicious. The cat tried his luck when his little pink nose sussed out the menu..

This personally pleasant day was enriched with two phone conversations with friends and two with family members. I’ve used up all my minutes for the first time in about 15 years!! Evening arrived, I finished settling the children, Andi washed up, and then we tuned in for the ministerial address. What a sobering moment for the country, or at least I hope it was. Without going into too much detail, daily life will now be even more unrecognisable than we could have imagined. My thoughts are so often with suffering people and populations anyway, but now I also include my home land, particularly those in the healthcare sector who have very little choice but to carry on caring despite the unfairly unavoidable risks. I’m reminded of Syria, I’m reminded of Italy, and I’m reminded of the novel _Atonement_ in which scenes of under pressure nurses in a wartime inundated hospital are so vividly depicted. Although I do not operate in this realm, I sincerely hope I can play my little part/s to the best of my ability, leaning on wisdom when it’s mine to use. Ciao for now.
