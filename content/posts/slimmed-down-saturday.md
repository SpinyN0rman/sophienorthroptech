Wren kitchen showroom was closed. This made sense, was looking for number to call anyway to ask if we could do a virtual appointment, when stumbled across blanket message about temporary store closures.

cleared some of jungle. Fun with centipede, cleaning tiles, moving brambles for mummy, uncovering old cases with daddy in hidden shed, after digging down to release door. Think this might be our last saunter to the bungalow, this feels privileged but nonessential. My heart sinks as the realisation that weâ€™ll be waiting even longer to move into our new home sinks in.

quiz night with friends. Go into detail.

lots of tv for girls. Also lots of play. Amber very helpful when asked to put things away. Sat down to do some maths questions and more facts before bed.

lots of dressing up, Ballerina & rainbow coloured, hair dos, and horses haircuts.

Chicken and mange tout with noodles and soy sauce.

feeling a little lower today.
