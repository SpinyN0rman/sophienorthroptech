On this Palm Sunday we participated in worship via a live stream again. One of the leaders retold the moving story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem, putting a vivid spin on it by comparing that ancient meaningful journey to various roads and landmarks in our own town as it stands today.

So joyful to see pages of faces on Zoom during the after-service-coffee! What a clever idea. It was sweet how people took it in turns to mute their microphones to allow others to be heard more clearly. I didn’t say much, but soaked up the dynamic for a while of folk seeing friends’ faces and laughing together despite circumstances.

Crackers play a useful bread-like part in lunchtimes now that popping out for supplies every other day is not considered ideal. Yummy cracker and cheese lunch with some fruit.

Soon after lunch another call, to Grandma, to wish her a happy birthday. Always lovely to speak to her. They were planning a takeaway dinner but sadly all in the vicinity were shut so leftovers were the celebratory dish of the day.

Feeling sleepy this afternoon, and a mild headache worsened while I tried to drift off, before finally subsiding.

While I semi-slept Andi played Top Trumps with the girls. They then all went out for a walk, to the local field, and left me to come around in peace. Once I was sure the headache had gone, I peeled myself off the sofa to sort out a box of paper and junk that had been gaining weight for a week or so. Enjoyed the quiet space to methodically rip out used notebook pages to create essentially a new one for the kids’ paper drawer. Managed to recycle lots of redundant stuff.

Relished in Childish Gambino’s eclectic sound while prepared the table for leftovers for our dinner, too.
