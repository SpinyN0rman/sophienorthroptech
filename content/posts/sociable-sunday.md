On this Palm Sunday we participated in worship via a live stream again. One of the leaders retold the moving story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem, putting a vivid spin on it by comparing that meaningful journey to various roads and landmarks in our own town. 

Feeling sleepy this afternoon, and a mild headache worsened while I tried to drift off, before finally subsiding.

While I semi-slept Andi played Top Trumps with the girls. They then all went out for a walk, to the local field, and left me to come around in peace. Once I was sure the headache had gone, I peeled myself off the sofa to sort out a box of paper and junk that had been gaining weight for a week or so. Enjoyed the quiet space to methodically rip out used notebook pages to create essentially a new one for the kidsâ€™ paper drawer. Managed to recycle lots of redundant stuff.
