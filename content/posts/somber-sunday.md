Had a carton like at church sometimes, us coffee, with one of our flapjacks each. Church was thought provoking, comforting, emotional.

again, feeling lower today. Less interested in children, more anxious. Made sure I took care of self, deliberate decision to slow everything down to help myself worry less while at work.

“grown up” telly for Clara,  noticing the age difference.

lots of dressing up. Business attire today.

lots of mess.

andi made the lovely gnocchi dish from his secret Santa cookbook for lunch. It was as mouthwatering as I remembered. A solid new favourite for me, maybe approaching spaghetti bolognese levels of adoration - which by the way since cutting down on meat has left a very large hole indeed in my comfort food repertoire!!

lady and the tramp with daddy and popcorn, kicked over the floor in a moment of enthusiastic acting.

girls went for a very brief nature walk with daddy across the road and around the churchyard.

i went to work, to complete what will probably be my last shift for a month, if not longer. I chose not to play music, but took it quietly and slowly and was Still really productive.

news extremely sobering again.

antiques roadshow was light relief. At Salisbury cathedral. Some fascinating objects - colour changing sapphire, 16th? Century dental tools, a Church dog separator, a laundry basher, letters from Enid blyton, highly valuable service medals, a Buddha from the 3rd or 4th century, the most exquisite embroidery, napoleon’s personal belongings, amazing cartoon work and painted Christmas cards, and queen victoria’s knickers!

home for cuppa, leftover buttery mash, some crisps, and opened the longer life bread (rye & seed).. I didn’t mind the change - but heck would the kids!
