PIC

dads birthday, strange not making plans to eat out.

lasagne, veggie, first make. Very impressed and had seconds! Ate in front of Aladdin with girls. Liked it!

quiz evening with family. Good to see their faces and hear their voices. Bitter sweet. A laugh. Gained a bit of general knowledge, sure it will be promptly forgotten but interesting nonetheless..
