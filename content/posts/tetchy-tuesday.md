Home school was not as romantic on day two as it was on day one. For any of us. I felt low this morning, was craving peace and quiet, and had a couple of phone calls to make before we could get started. Eldest daughter eager yet so sweetly patient to begin, youngest disinterested in this set up already. And so the perfect recipe for tetchiness.

Finally read a very pertinent book to kickstart “Home School” (on purpose) called **_You and me Little Bear_**, and took the opportunity to gush to the kids that even when our days are frustrating or interrupted with jobs, I love spending time together with them. Which is true - even when hints of depression make curling up in a ball away from all people _seem_ the most appealing way to spend time!

Other activities included:

* colouring in simple paper bookmarks,
* drawing step by step pictures using our favoured **_Art Hub for Kids_** You Tube channel,
* writing out a couple of facts for Nanny,
* Doing ONE maths problem, because “I hate maths”,
* Clara completing a couple of puzzles again; one with yours truly.

Excercise. **_PE with Joe_**. Amber managed ten minutes. Clara was umpire on-a-chair-on-a-table and fell so was then cross with me so didn’t join in.. until the dancing section when we had a lovely spin around together and for two minutes all was forgiven! I said,

“Woah that made me feel good, I think we’ll do it every day, what do you think?”

“NOOOOO! But how many days until his Fancy Dress Friday?”

Aah, he reeled them in with dressing up!! Thank you, Joe - this was a saving grace for me on a tricky day.

Fed the bubbas mini pizzas early, and then had a go at pizza dough for us grown ups’ meal. It was worth the try.. very tasty. Ate a TV dinner with some Pepsi Max. Deliberately taking a night off the news. I’ll allow myself an evening of ignorance in exchange for a better mood in the morning!
