Thursday has been a little unsettling, full of thankfulness, and from the girls even some theatre. They set up a stage outside today, and delivered a mixture of dance genres, including comedy dance (which only kids of that age can get away with!), complete with commentary. All in a rather chilly courtyard by the time the midday sun had been and gone.

It’s a small thing really but the food shop was the thing which unsettled me today, I think simply because it was so different to usual.
