No excuse not to brush teeth this morning. The children set up for a party in their room, which lead to all kinds of personal care and grooming! styled our hair, girls even put lipstick on! So instinctive, I very rarely wear makeup!

Thursday has been a little unsettling, full of thankfulness, and from the girls even some theatre. They set up a stage outside today, and delivered a mixture of dance genres, including comedy dance (which only kids of that age can get away with!), complete with commentary. All in a rather chilly courtyard by the time the midday sun had been and gone.

It’s a small thing really but the food shop was the thing which unsettled me today, I think simply because it was so different to usual, and yet some people seemingly still not keeping their distance. The checkout operator who served me was so unbelievably friendly, we had a lovely chat about the areas we’d lived in, the churches we’d married in, the fact that his wife was also beavering away two checkouts beyond, but I was wearing a mask (Although I’m not sure how effective it was, it gave me some comfort while weaving round and round Asda and the people sharing it) and he wasn’t, nor had he been given a screen yet. They’d done well to encourage distancing in queues and isles though.

Flung open the window and clapped at 20:04 for NHS (and other care sector) staff, almost forgetting the prearranged applause until I heard fireworks and eventually it clicked and I sprang to my feet!

Settling down to some light telly, Andi and I realised that aside from rationing our food, we’d be rationing Queer Eye, too, as we reach the end of the final available season. So half an episode it is! A sort of self inflicted cliffhanger..
