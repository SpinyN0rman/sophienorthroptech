Also didn’t set an alarm to wake up at a decent time. Also didn’t make time for breakfast for the first time in about three weeks - have been doing well!

Big fortnightly food shop. Left fresh fruit and veg until last and ran out of trolley room. Andi assured me when I returned home that it takes a while longer than I likely think for people to become malnourished. Point taken.

I didn’t manage the call with school friends we’d hoped for - looking forward to this tomorrow now instead.

Girls got a treat today - picked them up some new (matching) trainers, albeit cheap but nonetheless pink, from Asda while grocery shopping. They love them! They deserved a little something for adjusting so well to the new way of life. The second treat was beans on toast for dinner, due to beans and especially bread being rationed in our home lately!!
