I took this picture shortly after eating a lot of chocolate - not all in one go I hasten to add - I saved each wrapper as I went to remind me of the new delicious flavours, and just because they looked pretty!! My father in law hid a lovely selection bag of them in our house on visiting last year, and it wasn’t until a number of weeks down the line that I discovered them. Such a happy moment!
