Got some laundry done during the day. Hopefully the photo makes clear the fact I had two little helpers when hanging it out! So cute.

Watched Alicia Keys’ You Tube channel before bed. We were due to see her this Summer, something I’ve wanted to do for a very long time. Songs in A Minor was the first album on CD I ever bought as a kid! I was hoping for some words of wisdom from Keys during the pandemic, but nothing yet; I guess most celebs use Twitter for this - this could be the push I need to finally hook myself up with an account.

In the meantime, some cool music vids. One about entrepreneurial son. One about skin care and winding down routine at end of day. I’m not one for products, in fact I can’t be bothered with lotions and potions at all, so when I do it’s half hearted and sporadic at best! But after watching this I have a new wish list for next time I’m on my fortnightly supermarket sweep: a couple of things might be a tea tree oil or product, and a moisturiser for hands.

On beauty, the girls and I painted our nails today. Clara loves having this done, and I must admit that if the colour’s nice enough for me to keep it on for a week, I love it too! I’ve often considered trying something longer lasting such as Shellac one day. Could be practical for hands that scrub for a living. Maybe will look into cost, and environmental impact, once we can leave the house for non-essentials... My Mum’s friend always has such beautiful nails, yet not overdone, which I know she considers her treat to herself once every couple of weeks or so. Self care is indeed important, perhaps especially when it doesn’t come naturally ;)
