Resorted to waving to my friend, WhatsApp was so quiet, and then Zoom was silent for her and slightly improved for the rest of us. Was good to have contact, even if it was stinted. I think a few good old fashioned phone calls with some of my closest friends are overdue.

Clara played on my tablet this afternoon, and loves one particular Barbie game in which you can pamper the characters. (Here’s one of her nail salon jobs!)

Craft was the main order of the day for Amber, though. She made herself a princess bag from instructions in a book she received in her Christmas stocking a couple of years ago. Has spent a good few days wanting to make it, now we finally got round to it! Improvised a beautiful fan, too. Clara attempted the same book’s step by step fan from my relayed instructions, but not in the most cooperative mood today.

Had a lovely phone call with my Mum once moodiness had subsided a little! She has very kindly compiled a couple of home based scavenger hunts for the children to do on a day when all else is vanity.. I thought today could be the day but before I needed it on this occasion, PE saved the day..

It was the best one so far in as much as the children accepted my doing it, and joined in a bit more, making up their own excercises when too tricky/ enjoyed the routine of finding Joe’s three spot the differences. Very cute touch!

Squeezed in some last minute Maths & English work, which when tacked on to the craft made for a surprisingly productive day.
