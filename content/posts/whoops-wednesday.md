“Whoops!” because the children and I have for the last three mornings forgotten to brush our teeth after breakfast! Without the urgency of getting them dressed and tidying their hair, aiming for leaving the house or answering the door, I became lax extraordinarily quickly.. it just goes to show how frequently we are out and about in a typical week.

After watching the news this evening ”Whoops” too for the feeling of many in the UK that we’re untouchable when it comes to something like a pandemic because of our wealth and position in the western world. Not so.
