“Whoops!” because the children and I have for the last three mornings forgotten to brush our teeth after breakfast! Without the urgency of getting them dressed and tidying their hair, aiming for leaving the house or answering the door, I became lax extraordinarily quickly.. it just goes to show how frequently we are out and about in a typical week.

After watching the news this evening, ”whoops” too for the feeling of many in the UK (and other nations) that we’re untouchable when it comes to something like a pandemic because of our wealth and position in the western world. Not so. I naturally and often frustratingly wear a wide lens, and get upset by the most distant people’s hardship as my own, but I have to admit I was shocked to hear the number of cases in Spain had outnumbered those in China, and felt a wave of primal fear run down my body. That’s a good thing I’ve been told - we worry for a reason, and that reason is to then act in such a way as to promote survival. the reports this evening ought to have been sobering for all. This virus is vigorous and not at all picky.
