“Whoops!” because the children and I have for the last three mornings forgotten to brush our teeth after breakfast! Without the urgency of getting them dressed and tidying their hair, aiming for leaving the house or answering the door, I became lax extraordinarily quickly.. it just goes to show how frequently we are out and about in a typical week, and how routine encourages routine..

After watching the news this evening, possibly a ”whoops” too for the feeling of many in the UK (and other nations) that we’re untouchable when it comes to something like a pandemic because of our wealth and position in the western world. Not so. I naturally and often frustratingly wear a wide lens, and get as upset by the most distant people’s hardship as my own, but I have to admit I was shocked to hear the number of cases in Spain had outnumbered those in China, a former ice rink being used as a morgue, and to see frank video footage submitted by someone usually of good health battling the virus. I felt a wave of primal fear run down my body. That’s a good thing I’ve been told - we worry for a reason, and that reason is to then act in such a way as to promote survival. The reports this evening ought to have been sobering for all. This virus is vigorous and not at all picky.

On a happier note, and my mum is very good at finding the positive in any situation, much better than me!.. Apparently more than 400,000 people have so far signed up to volunteer with the NHS from home or out in the community.

Rather than “Panic! Everything is out of control!” Russell Brand’s interviewee repeats  a profound Buddhist sentiment, “Relax, everything is out of control.”

Girls made a den. Girls had a “play” bath, which just means they get out of washing per se, while I’m happy for them to have a good soak.

I had a bath. Despite relaxing, got a massive headache afterwards. Have made a note, but for now will put it down to anxiety. (Wrote this the following morning.)
