<article class="center bg-white br-3 pv1 ph4 lh-copy f5 nested-links mw7">
	<p>Day two in the Little Mother House, and it’s a Mother’s Day like no other! We began with the usual imperative CBeebies - Amber and Clara are in love with the television, and will beg, whinge and whine for it, so we have to ration it, but have chosen not to deny them of their love completely ;) A reasonable daily structure for them seems to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>TV first thing in the morning at weekends, until about half eight. Often one of us will sit with them for some of this viewing, and secretly I quite enjoy a bit of <em>Octonauts</em>, or <em>Tinga Tinga.</em></li>
<li>Occasionally a shorter stint at 11am, with a snack to keep them going until lunch..</li>
<li>Finally I let them watch a bit after school once they’ve settled in if they ask for it - usually they do - while I do the dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s not strict though. It depends on the day and the mood everyone’s in! I find myself saying “last one!” or “two more!” so that the strops when it gets turned off are minimised. They still strop!! Then there’s the occasional TV dinner treat, and films with popcorn. My favourite.</p>
<p>Got a bit sidetracked there.. On the subject of the screen however, we had a brand new experience this morning. Church came to our lounge. General social distancing advice, coupled with the Archbishops’ decision to close churches for Sunday worship until further notice, meant that we could not join in in the usual way. But boy did the leaders faithfully serve the community today! The staff requested photos of the congregation so that they could print them off and put faces on chairs instead of bums on chairs. They filmed a familiarly structured service and live streamed it. We were incredibly moved by this act and their words of encouragement. The toy dog was even present. Can you spot it?</p>
<p><img src="472BDDB0-2528-4110-A5BE-2981A1BE6F4B.jpeg" alt="">I dropped some things off at my parents’ home, leaving things on the doorstep and then texting “delivery!” and even had a brief conversation with them from a way down the driveway. That’s difficult, but we still get to see each other’s facial expressions and hear each other’s voices. It’s perhaps one up on a phone-call, and similar to a FaceTime, which is what we had as a family today with my extended family - technically speaking, the in-laws. That too was difficult for me in hindsight, because we’ve had to postpone our visits across the country again, but it is what it is. Still good and blessed.</p>
<p>On to an appointment with a kitchen manufacturer to finalise something for the jungle bungalow. No cups of tea thank you, and hand gel at the ready. Then a relatively empty grassy field for burning off steam, while I drifted and slept alone in the sun warmed car.. possibly my best Mother’s Day gift.</p>
<p>Home for cuppas, and eventually a dinner of gnocchi (very little pasta), baked in spiced tomato juice (tinned toms are a precious commodity), with peeled courgette and lots of garlic. Nice and filling. As we’re finishing up and tempting the kids with a couple more mouthfuls, Amber pipes up. She holds her hands about a foot apart, and inquires, “when older people shrink.. would they shrink this small?” I love the minds of children!</p>
<p>Apples for dessert. Our Japanese friend Manami, who’d visit regularly when Amber was an infant, once told us that desserts weren’t as popular in their culture as in the UK. She and her family often finish their evening meal with an apple, too.</p>
